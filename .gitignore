# Secrets and configuration files that should NOT be committed

# Sensitive data that might be in constants.dart if not careful
# It's better to use environment variables, but as a safeguard,
# you could try to exclude specific files if absolutely necessary,
# though this is NOT a reliable way to handle secrets.
# Example (NOT RECOMMENDED - use environment variables instead):
lib/utils/constants.dart

# Keystore files
*.jks
*.keystore
keystore.properties

# Firebase (if you ever add it and don't want to commit google-services.json directly)
# Though for public repos, it's often fine as it doesn't contain API keys directly.
# Consider your project's needs.
# /android/app/google-services.json
# /ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# Specific to your project if you have other local config files
# my_local_config.yaml
